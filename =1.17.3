Using version ^1.22.3 for numpy

  SolverProblemError

  The current project's Python requirement (>=3.7.1,<4.0) is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - numpy requires Python >=3.8, so it will not be satisfied for Python >=3.7.1,<3.8
  
  Because numpy (1.22.3) requires Python >=3.8
   and no versions of numpy match >1.22.3,<2.0.0, numpy is forbidden.
  So, because recommender-system depends on numpy (^1.22.3), version solving failed.

  • Check your dependencies Python requirement: The Python requirement can be specified via the `python` or `markers` properties
    
    For numpy, a possible solution would be to set the `python` property to ">=3.8,<4.0"
